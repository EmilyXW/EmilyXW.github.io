	<div class="roundedright yellow">
		<p>I love art because it's the perfect outlet for endless
			creativity and exploration. I've learned a lot from creating, whether
			it be drawing techniques or lessons on perseverance. Making art can
			be frustrating at times, but it's not something I'll ever give up.</p>
		<p>
			I'm most comfortable with pencil portraits, though over the past few
			years I've challenged myself to explore new mediums and subjects, as
			well as enter art competitions. <a

	<h2>Dance</h2>

	<div class="roundedleft blue clearfix">
		<p>
			I also love dance. Though I do get nervous before competing on stage,
			I always enjoy my time practicing and performing. Dance has taught me
			to have more confidence in myself, as well as that consistent effort
			and thorough preparation go a long way. I grew up constantly reading
			a poster in my dance studio that said, “Never settle for less than
			your best”. Sadly, the poster's been taken down, but I still apply
			its motto to everything I do. Overall, I’d say that dance has played
			a fundamental role in my growth, and I look forward to continuing my
			journey to improve. I danced at Greendale Dance Academy;
			here's their <a href="https://www.greendaledanceacademy.com/" target="_blank">website</a>!
		</p>
		<p>
			I am still dancing at Cornell, though now I’m trying new styles like Chinese traditional and lion dance.
			I thought I’d stop dancing in college, but it seems I just couldn’t resist the lure of challenging myself
			with new
			styles and performing once more under warm stage lights.

	<h2>Clubs</h2>
	<div class="roundedright yellow">
		<p>
			I’m part of Illuminations, Lion Dance, Guiding Eyes for the Blind, and Guild of Visual Arts at Cornell. I love creating, biomedical
			engineering
			topics, and working on things hands-on, so I’m hoping to get on a project team this year as well. I had so
			much
			fun and learned so much making an assistive technology project in STEM II at MAMS that I can’t wait to work
			on more projects at Cornell.
			By joining a project team, I hope to learn even more about challenges in healthcare and develop skills in
			engineering to tackle them head-on!
		</p>
		<p>I participated in many of Mass Academy's clubs, like
			Birdwatching, the school newspaper, Cooking Club, and Computer-Aided Design (CAD).
			While I was at my sending school, Westborough High School,
			I was a member in clubs including Science Olympiad, Art Club, and
			Math Team.</p>

	<h2>Community Service</h2>
	<div class="roundedleft blue">
		<p>
			I volunteered at the <a href="https://www.mentoradh.com/state-location/aging-well-adult-day-health-center/"
				target="_blank">Aging Well Adult Day Health Center</a> and the <a
				href="https://www.mywpl.org/?q=friends-library" target="_blank">
				Friends Bookstore</a> at the Worcester Public Library. Both places are
			full of kind, thoughtful people, so I always enjoy my time
			volunteering.
		</p>
		<p>Aging Well is a center that provides elders in the community
			with enrichment and care. There are many fun activities and welcoming
			staff there, so it's a wonderful place to be! I've helped out with many
			things during my time at Aging Well, from serving meals to leading
			games and translating questions for the nurses.</p>
		<p>The Friends Bookstore is a bookstore that is completely
			volunteer-run, and all profits go towards supporting the Worcester
			Public Library and its community. My favorite job I do there is
			sorting through and cleaning up books, though I also work the cash
			register, assist customers, and help organize the store. The bookstore could always use more customers and
			volunteers!</p>

	<h2>Animals</h2>
	<div class="roundedright yellow">
		<p>
			Since I have no siblings, I begged my parents for a dog or cat
			growing up. Though they finally relented after over a decade, the
			damage from years without a furry companion had been done: I’d
			developed an ever-growing obsession with my friends’ pets and other
			animals. Thus, I ended up shadowing at a veterinary clinic. At Cornell, I'm part of Guiding Eyes for the
			Blind, a club that raises seeing eye dogs.
			There couldn’t be a more perfect club for me. I get to play with puppies and help improve the lives of
			people in need of service dogs!
