	<h2>Course Description</h2>
	<div class="roundedright yellow">
		<p>
			As per tradition, the humanities course begins with the discussion of
			our summer reading book <i>Walden</i> by Henry David Thoreau.
			Following the exhilarating tale, we read and discuss a variety of
			literary, historical, and cultural texts related to the central
			question, "What does it mean to be human?". Additionally, to further
			explore this question and our texts, we write essays and collaborate
			on group projects related to each unit. Some topics we have discussed
			are the education system of the United States, race and ethnicity,
			and satire.

	<h2>Education Essay</h2>
	<div class="roundedleft blue">
		<p>One of our first major assignments came at the end of a series
			of readings discussing the American education system. The readings
			made me realize that our schools and curriculum are far from perfect,
			but also that there are small steps we can take to improve them.
			After all, there is always room for growth.</p>
		<p>Below is the first essay I wrote for humanities, which answers
			the question of what aspects of the American school system work and
			which I would change. I had a lot to say about my topic after the
			readings we discussed, so I found it a fun challenge trying to
			organize my thoughts and keep the flow of my essay. We did not have a
			maximum page limit for this essay, which I appreciated because it
			allowed me to explore more ideas.</p>

	<h2>Original Satire</h2>
	<div class="roundedright yellow">
		<p>
			An assignment I enjoyed was our satire project. After learning about
			satire and its many devices in class and reading documents such as <i>A
				Modest Proposal</i> by Dr. Jonathan Swift, we worked in small groups to
			make our own satires. I worked with Amy and Anne
			to create a satire on AI art, which we presented as a video. Both the
			script and the video are below; the script has sections highlighted
			to denote the use of satirical devices, with each color representing
			a different device. The key assigning colors to their respective
			devices is at the top of each page.
