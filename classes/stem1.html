		<p>Dr. Crowthers teaches STEM I.</p>
		<p>In STEM I, we we work on an engineering project called our
			"Build Something" project. Our goal is to design assistive devices

		<p>
			In addition to the Build Something project, we each work on a
			six-month long independent research project in STEM. Our research
			begins in the summer, when we start brainstorming topics and reading
			articles on them. Once we narrow down to a project, we work on it
			until our science fair in February. Over the course of our
			investigations, we learn about the research process and writing
			technical documents such as grant proposals. Below is my STEM

				<h2>Abstract</h2>
				<p>Understanding the functions of certain proteins may aid the
					world in its efforts to combat the global health threat of
					antimicrobial resistance.</p>
				<p>
					Antimicrobials are critical to the treatment of bacterial
					infections. However, many bacteria have developed antimicrobial
					resistance (AMR), which was declared among the ten most critical
					threats to public health by the World Health Organization. NucS is
					a protein that repairs resistance-causing mismatches in
					mycobacteria, and further understanding of its function may provide
					insight into AMR in mycobacteria, including in <i>M.
						tuberculosis</i>.
				</p>
				<p>
					This project aims to determine the function of the five amino acid
					sequence at the C-terminal of NucS. In this project, NucS was
					tagged with fluorescent proteins by constructing the plasmid pEW2,
					containing mCherry. Plasmid pEW2 was then then integrated into the
					genome of <i>M. smegmatis</i>. Afterwards, the bacteria were
					observed under a fluorescence microscope and grown on rifampicin
					plates. Though foci were seen, they were in different locations in
					the cell. It was subsequently found that the bacteria were
					mutagenic. Such a result may suggest that the five C-terminal amino
					acids serve a purpose in addition to binding to DnaN, though more
					research will be needed.
				</p>
				<p>The plasmid made in this investigation can be used to further
					investigate the amino acids, locations, and interactions of NucS,
					such as during different cell processes or when an amino acid or
					the promoter of NucS is changed.</p>

			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>Antimicrobials are critical in the treatment of bacterial
				infections and thus the preservation of global health. However, many
				bacteria can develop antimicrobial resistance (AMR) ​ (Davies &amp;
				Davies, 2010). ​ AMR can be conferred in many ​ ways, though the
				most common ​ method involves mutations ​ (Annunziato, 2019). ​​ ​
				The increase in AMR poses ​ a major risk to global health, ​ with
				death rates caused ​ by AMR predicted to ​ skyrocket to 10
				million deaths ​ annually within the next three ​ decades (Ten
				Health Issues ​ WHO Will Tackle This ​ Year, 2019).</p>
			<p>NucS has been shown ​ to prevent mutations in ​ mycobacteria,
				a genus ​ which includes ​ mycobacterium tuberculosis. ​ More
				understanding of its precise function may elucidate further
				directions for protecting and promoting DNA repair in mycobacteria.</p>
			<p>Investigating the interactions of NucS with other proteins in
				the repair pathway is one such inquiry that would shed light on its
				function (Cebrián-Sastre et al., 2021). Such interactions may be
				observed by tagging NucS.​​</p>

					title="Procedure Infographic"></iframe>
			</div>


			<div class="column rounded blue">
				<h2>Procedure</h2>
				<p>To tag NucS with mCherry, a plasmid, pEW2, needed to be
					constructed from a mCherry insert and a backbone vector derived
					from pKM469. We cut both our insert and backbone at their HindIII
					and XbaI sites to form overhangs, or sticky ends, in their DNA.
					Finally, we ligated the cut insert and plasmid to form pEW2, the
					plasmid we would use to tag NucS.</p>
				<p>Following the formation of pEW2, we electroporated pEW2 into
					E. coli to clone it. As our intended plasmid had chloramphenicol
					resistance, we selected for bacteria with the plasmid by plating on
					chloramphenicol. We then purified candidates for sequencing using
					the Qiagen plasmid purification kit and sent them for sequencing.
					Next, we used the ORBIT method of recombineering (for more
					information on the ORBIT process, see Murphy et al., 2018) to
					integrate the correct plasmid into the chromosome of <i>M. smegmatis</i>
					before the replisome tag. Successful colonies were selected for by
					plating on hygromycin. PCRs were performed on selected colonies on
					the plate and the junctions formed were both run on a gel and sent
					for sequencing to ensure successful tagging of NucS.</p>
				<p>To determine mutagenicity, the <i>M. smegmatis</i> strains
					containing NucS tagged with mCherry were plated on rifampicin, and
					<i>M. smegmatis</i> strains with deletions in the nucS gene and wild-type
					strains of <i>M. smegmatis</i> were plated as the positive and negative
					controls, respectively.</p>
				<p>To determine if and where the mCherry-tagged NucS could be
					seen in the cell, we utilized fluorescence microscopy, with
					untagged <i>M. smegmatis</i> as our control.</p>

			<div class="rounded blue">
				<p>Figure 3​</p>
				<p>Six samples each of a wild type <i>M. smegmatis</i> strain, a strain
					containing NucS tagged with mCherry, and a strain containing a
					deletion in nucS were plated on rifampicin. Their average percent
					frequencies of mutation were then calculated and graphed.​</p>
			</div>
		</div>


		<div class="rounded blue">
			<h2>Analysis</h2>
			<p>As indicated by our graph, there was a significant difference
				between the frequency of mutation of our wild type and our
				NucS-mCherry strains, but not between our ΔNucS and mCherry strains,
				indicating that our mCherry tag interfered with the ability of NucS
				to cleave mutations. This result suggests that the five C-terminal
				amino acids of NucS may be necessary for functions of NucS other
				than binding, or that additional amino acids may be necessary for
				binding.​</p>
			<p>We cannot draw conclusions on the interaction between NucS and
				DnaN because our tagged NucS did not have standard function and may
				not have accurately reflected the interaction of wild type NucS with
				DnaN.</p>
		</div>


		<div class="rounded blue">
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>As mutations are a key cause of antimicrobial resistance in
				bacteria, learning more about proteins such as NucS which prevent
				mutations may open new paths to researching and addressing
				antimicrobial resistance.</p>
				<p>This project constructed a plasmid to
				investigate the function of the replisome tag of NucS and found that
				separating it from the rest of the protein caused increased
				mutagenicity.</p>
				<p>Further research may involve tagging NucS at its
				N-terminal and DnaN with GFP.​</p>
