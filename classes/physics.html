	<h2>Course Description</h2>
	<div class="roundedright yellow">
		<p>In physics, we learn about topics such as mechanics,
			electricity, and waves. We investigate each by developing our own
			experiments or observing demonstrations then modeling relationships
			with equations and graphs. Additionally, while solving problems, we
			work both independently and collaboratively and report our findings
			through written reports and presentations. Our physics class closely
			follows that of the AP physics curriculum, with both an algebra and a
			calculus track available.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Car Lab</h2>
	<div class="roundedleft blue">
		<p>
			The Car Lab was one of our first physics labs. It was done at the
			beginning of the year, when we were exploring the relationships
			between distance, velocity, and acceleration. In the lab, we had to
			investigate the motion of two different cars. One car was
			battery-operated, while the other was a cart that could not move on
			its own. We worked in small groups to design the system we would use
			to investigate the speed and acceleration of each car. Following
			setup, we collected data and communicated results with a written
			report. My partners for this lab were Anyee and Nihitha.

	<h2>Momentum Lab</h2>
	<div class="roundedright yellow">
		<p>
			In our momentum lab, we worked in groups to investigate collisions
			between two cars. I worked with Amy and Suhruth on
			this lab. I thought it was fun, and it helped further my
			understanding of momentum and energy. We collected data such as
			velocity and mass to investigate questions on how kinetic
			energy changed during different collisions and whether the
			impulse-momentum theorum held true during different scenarios. Each
			group then made and presented a slideshow of the two problems they
			investigated, as well as an interesting feature from the software we
			used to graph our data.
