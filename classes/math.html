	<h2>Course Description</h2>
	<div class="roundedleft blue">
		<p>
			In math modeling, we use math– everything from algebra to statistics–
			to simulate and generate solutions to real-world problems. Through
			working independently and with peers, we learn from each other and
			challenge ourselves to explore various mathematical concepts and
			solutions. The year begins with a discussion of our summer reading
			book, <i>Fermat's Enigma</i> by Simon Singh. Next comes a unit
			starring a deck of cards; a 72-hour math competition, HIMCM; and some
			problems we model using Mathematica. We are constantly encouraged to
			challenge ourselves with the problems we encounter, whether as
			homework, classwork, or part of a math competition. Collaboration is
			key to this class, where the solution is never clear at first glance.
		</p>

	<h2>HiMCM</h2>
	<div class="roundedright yellow">
		<p>
			At MAMS, we participate in a number of math competitions. The first
			is HiMCM (High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling), where we
			work in small groups and have 72 hours to propose a solution to one
			of two problems provided by the competition. My partners were Amy and Shuling; we chose to do problem A, which had us
			model the population of a bee colony over time, determine the factor
			that impacts bee colonies the most, and calculate how many hives are
			needed to pollinate a 20-acre farm. We chose this problem because we
			liked bees and already knew a decent amount of information about them. Or so we thought. Once we started researching, we found many facts about bees
			that we didn't know, with each adding a layer of complexity to the
			problem. Thus, we decided to begin with a simplified model, which we would then build on by factoring in variables we identified during our research.</p>

	<h2>Epsilon School</h2>
	<div class="roundedleft blue">
		<p>The Epsilon School problem was one of the first modeling
			problems we did this year. It challenged us to decide how seven newly
			hired teachers would be divided between each of eleven subjects for
			the coming school year. We were given information such as the number
			of students in each subject, the number of grades in the school, the
			percentage of students that would drop out, and that the number of
			incoming students would increase for the coming year due to a school
			expansion.</p>
		<p>
			We worked on the problem in groups then presented results to the
			class. My partners were Lily and Travis, and we made a model where we focused on
			maintaining the same ratios (such as the ratio of subject enrollments
			to the number of teachers for the subject) year to year. Our method
			of deciding the number of new teachers alloted to a subject involved
			several steps. Thus, for the benefit of our audience during
			presentations, we demonstrated our process by using an example,
			biology, which we highlighted in green in each table in the slideshow below.
