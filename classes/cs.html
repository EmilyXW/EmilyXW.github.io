	<h2>Course Description</h2>
	<div class="roundedleft blue">
		<p>Our computer science course begins with web design: we learn
			about the qualities of an effective website, develop personal
			websites using HTML and CSS, and maintain our websites throughout the
			year. Following our web design unit, we transition into coding using
			java, during which we explore a variety of topics such as data types,
			iteration and recursion, graphics, and algorithms. Additionally,
			throughout the year, we have three major projects. The first is, as
			previously mentioned, our personal website. The next is the
			development of a software product, and the final one is our project
			to develop a mobile application that addresses a need in the
			community.</p>

	<h2>Apps for Good Project</h2>
	<div class="roundedright yellow">

		<p>
			<b>Background</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			The Apps for Good project is a project in which we work together in
			groups of two or three to identify and address a need. My teammates
			were Donovan and Kweku. After much deliberation, our group
			decided to create an app, VolunTour, to connect volunteers with local
			volunteer organizations. We chose this project because we had a
			shared passion for volunteering and community service, and were thus
			aware of several areas which could be improved upon.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Problem</b>
		</p>
		<p>The main issues we hoped to address were the challenges
			concerning communication between organizations and volunteers. For
			example, we observed that most volunteer opportunities were found
			through acquaintances and word of mouth, which limited both the
			amount and types of organizations volunteers were exposed to and the
			extent of an organization's outreach. Additionally, we found that a
			key struggle most organizations faced was keeping their volunteers
			informed of events and keeping track of volunteers.</p>
		<p>
			<b>Minimum Viable Product</b>
		</p>
		<p>A central feature we implemented in our app was the ability for
			organizations to create events, which volunteers could then search
			for and see the information of. Users would first select an option to
			become either a volunteer or organization admin. Afterwards, the
			volunteers could select skills and interests and search for matching
			events within a certain distance of their zip code. Meanwhile,
			organizations would be able to make, view, and edit events for
			volunteers.</p>

	<h2>AWT Graphics</h2>
	<div class="roundedleft blue">
		<p>AWT Graphics was a lab we did to learn more about methods in
			the Graphics class. It had us draw circles, lines, arcs, and
			filled-in shapes to create four given images. Predictably, there were
			challenges to overcome along the way. For example, it took me some
			time to make shapes tangent to each other in one drawing and figure
			out how to draw filled-in arcs for another. However, the challenges I
			faced while coding this lab only made it all the more rewarding to
			work through issues and see each image come together. Below are my
			images and the code for them.</p>

	<h2>Line Art</h2>
	<div class="roundedright yellow">
		<p>I found the Line Art lab very satisfying to do. In it, we were
			challenged to make an image using only straight, evenly-spaced lines.
			What we had to do was straightforward, though keeping the code simple
			took some trial and error. I like the pattern the lines make in the
			end. It looks complicated, but it's only comprised of some lines
			following set rules. Just like how this program uses simple lines to
			make a complex drawing, a few lines of code can produce wonderful
			things!</p>
